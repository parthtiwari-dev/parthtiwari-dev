# Hi there! 👋 I'm Parth Tiwari

## 🚀 AI Engineer & Backend Developer
**Building intelligent systems that solve real problems, not just completing tutorials.**

I specialize in creating production-ready applications spanning fraud detection, e-commerce systems, and data analytics platforms. My focus is on shipping scalable, well-architected solutions using modern AI/ML technologies.

## 🚀 Current Projects

• **FraudX** - Production-grade fraud detection engine with configurable rule sets, schema validation, and comprehensive logging. Features modular architecture with pluggable rules and real-time transaction processing.

• **E-commerce Simulation System** - Enterprise-level Python backend showcasing OOP design patterns, caching strategies, and stress testing. Demonstrates production-ready system architecture with <100ms response times.

• **SQL Analytics Portfolio** - Advanced business intelligence projects including Brazilian e-commerce analysis (Olist dataset) and IMDb analytics with 40+ interview-level SQL challenges covering CTEs, window functions, and complex joins.

• **AI Engineering Journey** - Live documentation of ML/GenAI development including practical implementations, system design patterns, and real-world project builds.

## 🛣️ Technical Evolution
**Current Focus:** Python Systems → Fraud Detection → Advanced SQL Analytics → GenAI Integration  
**Next Phase:** Deep Learning Applications → MLOps & System Deployment → Real-time AI Services  
**Vision:** Building end-to-end AI products that scale from proof-of-concept to production deployment.
