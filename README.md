# Hi there! 👋 I'm Parth Tiwari

**Building products from SQL to AI, not just 'completing tutorials.'**

I'm on a mission to create real-world applications that solve actual problems. My journey focuses on building impactful products using data science, machine learning, and AI technologies.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- **SQL Olist Analytics** - Advanced real-world SQL analytics project using Brazilian E-Commerce data for comprehensive business intelligence
- **AI Engineer Journey** - Daily learning grind: notes, projects, DSA, and real results documented publicly
- **Upcoming Python/ML/GenAI builds** - Working on practical applications that bridge data science with real-world solutions

## 🛣️ My Roadmap
**SQL → Python → ML → GenAI → Deep Learning → Real-World Apps**
